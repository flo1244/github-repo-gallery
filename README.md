## Overview
I created a GitHub Repo Gallery as a part of my JavaScript milestone project. This project uses  the GitHub API to pull data from my account to populate name, bio, location, and the number of public repos. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Use dynamic search functionality to search for my repo names.
- Click on repo to see more information and get a link to the repo on GitHub.
- Go back to repo gallery to continue learning more about my repos.

## My process
Used Function Expression for coding my JavaScript. This allowed me to break down the project into smaller parts and allows for better readbility and organization. I used the functions to execute a particular event and to render data from the API.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS3
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Design
- JavaScript
- API


## Acknowledgments

I've had a long journey through Front-End Development Bootcamp and still more to come. I would like to thank my instructors and the Skillcrush community giving me the knowledge and tools to develop my skills. This journey will continue as I will reinforce my learning with projects and intergrate new languages(React & Ruby).
